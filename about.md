title: About me
---

My name is Emiliano Ciavatta. I was born in 1996 in Cesena, but I live near Rimini, a city I deeply love. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Information Science and my Master's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Bologna. I've been passionate about computer science since I was a child, and I began writing my first programs during high school, which I attended at the Technical Institute for Surveyors. I currently work as a software engineer at [Tinexta Cyber](https://www.tinextacyber.com/), an Italian company specializing in cybersecurity.

I love programming languages, I always like to learn new ones and discover their most advanced features. I am a code perfectionist, as well as writing efficient code I tend to give a lot of weight to style, to the fact that a source of being simple, clear and clean. I mainly use Linux operating systems with which I have a lot of experience. I like to design the software and go through all the steps until release. I particularly like the automated testing and continuous integration/continuous delivery phase.
Although I am able to create graphical interfaces, I am not interested in this area, as well as for machine learning.

I am passionate about cybersecurity, which is also the field I work in. During my university years, I was part of the [Ulisse](https://ulisse.unibo.it/) and [CeSeNA](https://cesena.github.io/) cybersecurity research teams. I also participated in several Capture The Flag (CTF), international level competitions whose aim is to discover (and sometimes fix) vulnerabilities in computer systems. In 2019 I participated in the Cyberchallenge, a cybersecurity training program organized by the CINI National Cybersecurity Laboratory with the support of the Ministry of Defense. With the Unibo team, made up of four people, I participated in the national final, a competition in which 18 Italian universities took part, and with my team we [classified second](https://magazine.unibo.it/archivio/2019/07/01/cyberchallenge-italiana-medaglia-dargento-per-i-cyber-defender-unibo).

I am an activist with [Alan Turing](https://www.arcigay.rimini.it/) "Alan Turing", an organization dedicated to promoting the rights of LGBTQIA+ people in Italy. Within the organization, I serve as Vice President and Treasurer.
